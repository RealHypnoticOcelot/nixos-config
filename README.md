# Hypnix

My home-grown NixOS config! I've tried my very best to make the config as modular, maintainable, and expandable as possible.
See `flake.nix` for an explanation of how everything works.

I haven't actually been able to try this out on a machine yet, since I'm waiting for a laptop to arrive. If you see any glaring issues, please open an issue!

Big thanks to [dbeley](https://dbeley.ovh/en/) for providing inspiration on how to properly structure this repo!
